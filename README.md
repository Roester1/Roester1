I am a Java, Web, and Javascript developer residing in Budapest, Hungary. I thrive on tackling challenging tasks and enjoy breaking them down into smaller, more manageable modules. My work encompasses the development of both smaller and larger-scale websites, including the creation of user interfaces, secure web applications, and e-commerce platforms.

Additionally, I specialize in designing and building Java-based applications. I embrace challenges, and if you are seeking someone to bring your vision to life, you are in capable hands.
